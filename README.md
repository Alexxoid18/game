## Instructions

The project is a memory game, based on a chess grid.

How to play: 

* A user selects a card and opens a chess piece.
* If the second card is similar then the two chess pieces remain upside down.
* The game ends when the user finds all the eight different matching combinations.
* A pop-up window shows the final score of the user.

Score calculation:

Score is based on the player Moves:
* If there are more than 15, a star is removed.
* If there are more than 20, a second star is removed.

Final score contains information about number of player's moves, conquered stars and time spent.
